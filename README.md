# Energy Trading Marketplace

## Project Description

The Energy Trading Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on Soroban that enables peer-to-peer energy trading. It allows prosumers (those who both produce and consume energy) to sell their excess energy directly to consumers, bypassing traditional utility companies. This creates a more efficient, transparent, and cost-effective energy marketplace.

The smart contract manages the entire trading process, including listing energy offers, tracking energy consumption and production, facilitating secure transactions, and maintaining a transparent ledger of all activities.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the energy sector by creating a decentralized marketplace that:

1. Empowers individuals and communities by giving them control over their energy resources
2. Reduces dependency on centralized utility providers
3. Incentivizes renewable energy production
4. Creates a more resilient and sustainable energy ecosystem
5. Provides fair pricing through a transparent, competitive marketplace
6. Lowers entry barriers for small-scale energy producers

By leveraging blockchain technology through Soroban, we aim to create a trustless environment where energy producers and consumers can interact directly, eliminating intermediaries and reducing costs while increasing efficiency.
